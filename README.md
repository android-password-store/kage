# The Community Cryptography Test Vectors

CCTV is an experiment, part of the [Community Cryptography Specification Project](https://c2sp.org), in test vector collection and reuse.

All cryptography-related test vectors are welcome, and projects are encouraged to reuse them and contribute back any new vectors they generate.
